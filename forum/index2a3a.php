<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">AIMBOT: 10/10:</span></b>  It got literally everything you need, a small thing that would maybe be nice was a custom key option but most people prob use mouse 2 anyways                                ^^ Aimbot works really good, you can either turn on rage with auto wall head only etc. or choose the option to use a certain FOV with Silentaim                                   which makes you look legit when you use a small FOV...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I've been using the mw3 cheat for almost a month now so I figured it was about time to write a review.<br />
<br />
aimbot 10/10 I've never really had any problems with the aimbot, it does what aimbot is supposed to do. It also has multiple feauters like silent aim and you can also customize the FoV for your liking, this means you can play with a legit style or a rage style. <br />
<br />
<br />
esp 10/10 I gave the esp a 10 because it's very, and I mean very customizable, it has everything you'd want from a wallhack...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">After purchasing a day for the MW3 cheat, I can honestly say it's spot on. The entire menu was easy to navigate and pretty easy to set up too. There weren't any flaws that I found when during the gameplay whilst using and going almost obvious- people still didn't actually call me out due to previous games with them. The aimbot, in my opinion, was a little hard to get used to (New to COD cheating, probably why) but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty simple. Visuals tab was extremely...<br />

i've recently bought MW2 again and I was curious about cheats for this game. As I was searching I obviously stumbled  upon some horrible free cheats and other detected bs, which for this game is a lot you can find.<br />
As I finally found this cheat though I looked at the Screenshots and Videos and I knew I need to try this one out. Luckily you are awesome enough to offer a 1day subscription so people can try ur cheats out. Here's what I think about the MW2 Version of Sesh Hooks:<br />

aimbot 10/10: The aimbot is very good and solid. No fps drops or ping drops what's so ever. I like the fact that the developers included silent aim as not a whole lot of hacks have this. You also have fov aimbot so you can either rage or play legit. <br />
<br />
esp 10/10: the esp is very good and supports thousands of different colors. You have team esp enemy esp and much more. Included also is charms. This makes this cheat defiently feel like a...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hey guys, I recently started testing the MW2 cheat and it's better than any p2c I've used before. Has a wide variety of cool features. It could be improved(console commands) but improvement is not really needed. People get mad when I endgame on them. Nospread + Norecoil + silent aim + 360 fov + autoshoot is OP. You will have a great time if you get the cheat. You won't regret getting it.</div>]]></content:encoded>

modern warfare series:<br />
this is my favorite cheat. I specifically like the customization of the cheat. how you can change almost every thing to your liking. even the background picture of the menu!! how you can tell whether someone is in your view or not with different color indicators on the ESP. how the aim bot settings can be as ridiculous as you want them...<br />
